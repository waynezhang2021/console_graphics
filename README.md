# console_graphics
A simple program/library that uses the Win32 SetPixel() function to draw simple graphs on a windows console

here is an intro of the files in it:

plot_graph.cpp draws graphs from file directly

rand_graph.cpp generates a random graph

reduce_noise.cpp reduces noise in graph

simple_binary.cpp uses a strange way to make graphs binary

binary_graph.cpp draws graphs in binary

func_graph.cpp generates a graph containing some functions(e.g. lines,sine waves)

bw_graph.cpp draws graphs to black-and-white

line.cpp is a simple program that draws lines(warning:there are bugs in it)

graphics.cpp is a minimal graphic library with a demo
